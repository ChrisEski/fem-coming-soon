## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

During this project, I had the opportunity to deal with vanilla JS email validation, using regular expression. Also wrapped repetive code on it's own function, making my code clearer for future review.
As far as the styling is concerned, I found the layout pretty challenging in the beginning. I manipulated flex properties (flex grow/shrink/basis) for the first time, not using the shorthand `flex` property.

### Continued development

Next I will focus on going deeper into using flexbox in order to better understand how to use its properties correctly.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQAvjof1oe4&t=63s) - For one more time Kevin's videos saved me a lot of frustration and helped me working with flex properties individually for the first time!
